**GhostVault setup for MacOS**

To begin, either log into the machine or open a terminal window if installing locally.

**1. Installing Dependencies**

We will begin by installing Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS. You can read more about Brew on their official [website](https://brew.sh/)

To install Homebrew, run the following command

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once the Homebrew installation is complete, we can move on with installing Python.

```
brew install python
```

The rest of the GhostVault installation on MacOS is the same as on Linux.
