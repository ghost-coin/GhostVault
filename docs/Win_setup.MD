Once downloaded, run the installer. Click on the `Next` button until it becomes the `Install` button. Then click the `Install` button.



**2. Download GhostVault and install Python modules**

Open a cmd window buy clicking on the start menu. Once the menu is up, type `cmd`, then click on `Command Prompt` to open a cmd window.

Enter the following command to download GhostVault and to change into the new directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/ghost-coin/GhostVault && cd GhostVault
```

Now to install the needed Python modules enter the following command

```

Now you are ready to continue on to the Universal Quickstart guide found in the main [readme](https://github.com/ghost-coin/GhostVault)

**NOTE** 

While GhostVault is running, a cmd window will open with ghostd running in it. This window must stay open at all times. If this
window is closed, staking will stop.
